Program Bounciness
Author Chandler Woodard
Purpose Write a program that lets the user enter the initial height from which the ball is dropped, the bounciness index, and the number of times the ball is allowed to continue bouncing. Output should be the total distance traveled by the ball.
"""

#Get the input of the bounce hight and time, while also getting out variables
h1 = float(input("Enter the height from which the ball is dropped: "))
b1 = float(input("Enter the bounciness index of the ball: "))
bb1 = int(input("Enter the number of times the ball is allowed to continue bouncing: "))

#this will get the variable for the distance
distance = 0

#Now this will work out the distance hieight and the lower bounces of  the ball

while bb1 > 0:
    distance = distance + h1
    h1 = h1 * b1 
    distance = distance + h1
    bb1 -= 1

    #This will print the results
print("The distance travelled by the ball is %.3f" % distance)
